<h3>Camilo Doval - MLB Pitching Dashboard</h3>

<p>Welcome to the <b>Camilo Doval Pitching Dashboard</b>, a fully interactive analytics project designed to visualize the five-year performance of one of MLB’s top high-leverage relievers using Python, real Statcast data, and Streamlit.</p>

<h4>🚀 Project Purpose</h4>
<p>As an aspiring <b>MLB Player Development</b> or <b>R&D Analyst</b>, I built this dashboard to showcase my ability to combine player development insights, data storytelling, and baseball analytics. This project reflects my commitment to developing the skills front offices value—blending <b>analytical thinking</b>, <b>baseball intelligence</b>, and <b>human development</b>.</p>
<p>The goal of this dashboard is to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Demonstrate player development trends</li>
  <li>Communicate advanced baseball metrics visually</li>
  <li>Scale easily for future player comparisons or team-level analysis</li>
</ul>

<h4>👩‍💻 About the Creator</h4>
<p>Hi, I’m <b>Liza Osterdock</b>, a bilingual (English/Spanish), purpose-driven professional transitioning into MLB after 20+ years in high-tech, data analysis, and e-commerce. My background in <b>leadership</b>, <b>software engineering</b>, <b>program design</b>, and <b>business strategy</b> allows me to bridge the gap between analytics and the human side of the game.</p>
<p>I’m deeply committed to building resilient, development-first, player-centric environments rooted in the “<b>Play Big</b>” mentality—anchored in mental performance, leadership, and high standards.</p>

<h4>📊 What the Dashboard Displays</h4>
<p>The app presents <b>4 key pitching metrics</b> for Camilo Doval (2021–2025):</p>

<p><b>1. Velocity & Spin Rate</b><br>
📈 <i>What it shows:</i> Yearly averages of pitch velocity and spin rate.<br>
🔍 <i>Why it matters:</i> Measures raw power and pitch movement effectiveness.</p>

<p><b>2. Pitch Usage Percentages</b><br>
📊 <i>What it shows:</i> How often each pitch type is thrown each year (FC, FF, SI, SL).<br>
🧠 <i>Why it matters:</i> Reflects pitch selection strategies and player evolution.</p>

<p><b>3. Release Extension</b><br>
🢅 <i>What it shows:</i> How far in front of the rubber the ball is released.<br>
⏱ <i>Why it matters:</i> Impacts perceived velocity and deception.</p>

<p><b>4. Whiff Rate</b><br>
💨 <i>What it shows:</i> Swing-and-miss rate.<br>
🔑 <i>Why it matters:</i> Reflects dominance and ability to miss bats.</p>
