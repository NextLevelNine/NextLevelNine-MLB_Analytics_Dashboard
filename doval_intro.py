<h4>Project Purpose</h4>
<p>As a bilingual, purpose-driven professional aspiring to transition into a Major League Baseball position, I built this dashboard to merge scouting instincts with modern analyticsâ€”through the lens of leadership, player development, and human performance. This project reflects my unique ability to translate data into meaningful, player-focused insight, shaped by over 20 years in business strategy, technology, and mental performance.</p>
<p>My goal was to design a tool that not only visualizes performance metrics, but also mirrors the decision-making needs of todayâ€™s MLB front offices. With a strong foundation in baseball analytics, scouting, and player development, this project demonstrates my ability to communicate insights clearly, build scalable systems, and align data storytelling with long-term athlete growth.</p>

<h4>Project Overview</h4>
<p>I created this dashboard using Python to evaluate the past five seasons of an MLB pitcherâ€™s performance. For this case study, I selected San Francisco Giants reliever Camilo Doval and pulled Statcast data covering 2020â€“2025.</p>
<p>Before scripting, I reviewed Dovalâ€™s pitch arsenal, usage trends, and public scouting reports to ensure alignment between raw data and real-world insights. I then used tools like pybaseball, pandas, and matplotlib to extract, clean, and visualize performance patterns. The final result is a public-facing, interactive dashboard hosted via Streamlit Cloud.</p>

<h4>What the Dashboard Displays</h4>
<ol>
  <li><b>Velocity & Spin Rate:</b> Shows Dovalâ€™s power and pitch movement quality. His velocity peaked in 2023 (95.26 mph), and spin rebounded to 2555.13 rpm in 2025.</li>
  <li><b>Pitch Usage Breakdown:</b> Visualizes pitch mix evolution. Slider usage grew to 58.1% in 2025; sinker use declined.</li>
  <li><b>Release Extension:</b> Tracks release point distance. Remained consistent around 6.3â€“6.6 feet across years.</li>
  <li><b>Whiff Rate:</b> Measures swing-and-miss dominance. Maintained elite whiff rates above 0.92 in all five seasons.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Project Framework Using S.M.A.R.T.</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>Specific:</b> Analyze Dovalâ€™s pitching trends (2020â€“2025)</li>
  <li><b>Measurable:</b> Four core metrics across five seasons</li>
  <li><b>Achievable:</b> Built using Python, PyBaseball, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Streamlit</li>
  <li><b>Relevant:</b> Supports player development, scouting, and front office decision-making</li>
  <li><b>Time-bound:</b> Completed in one week as a capstone MVP</li>
</ul>

<h4>Development Process</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>pull_doval_data.py</b>: Pulled Statcast data (2020â€“2025) â†’ <code>camilo_doval_5yr_statcast.csv</code></li>
  <li><b>doval_pitching_analysis.py</b>: Generated four key metric summaries into CSVs</li>
  <li><b>doval_charts.py</b>: Created PNG visualizations using Matplotlib</li>
  <li><b>pull_doval_advanced.py</b>: Placeholder FanGraphs metrics â†’ <code>doval_advanced_stats.csv</code></li>
  <li><b>merge_doval_data.py</b>: Combined files into <code>doval_complete_profile.csv</code></li>
</ul>

<h4>Technical Stack</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>Data Sources:</b> Statcast (PyBaseball), FanGraphs (CSV)</li>
  <li><b>Libraries:</b> pandas, matplotlib, pybaseball</li>
  <li><b>App Framework:</b> Streamlit</li>
  <li><b>Hosting:</b> Streamlit Community Cloud</li>
</ul>

<h4>Version 1: MVP Scope</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Pulls, cleans, and analyzes 5-year Statcast data</li>
  <li>Interactive charts and tables for 4 metrics</li>
  <li>Scalable for multi-pitcher or team use</li>
</ul>

<h4>Version 2: Future Enhancements</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Pitcher comparison view and dropdown selection</li>
  <li>FanGraphs integration: WAR, K/9, FIP, WPA, etc.</li>
  <li>PDF/CSV export for scouts and coaches</li>
  <li>Mobile optimization and layout refinement</li>
</ul>
