<h4>Project Overview</h4>

<p>This project was created to explore how advanced baseball analytics can be transformed into an interactive visual tool to evaluate MLB pitchers' performance over time. The goal was to build a clean, engaging, and accessible dashboard that showcases Camilo Doval’s five-year pitching trends using Python, real MLB data, and Streamlit.</p>

<p><b>As a bilingual (English/Spanish), purpose-driven professional with 20+ years in high-tech, e-commerce, and analytics, I am transitioning into MLB with a deep focus on player development and R&D. This dashboard reflects my passion, technical skills, and human-centered approach to baseball performance.</b></p>
