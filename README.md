# Camilo Doval - MLB Pitching Dashboard

Welcome to the **Camilo Doval Pitching Dashboard**, a fully interactive analytics project designed to visualize the five-year performance of one of MLB’s top high-leverage relievers using Python, real Statcast data, and Streamlit.

## 🚀 Project Purpose
As an aspiring **MLB Player Development** or **R&D Analyst**, I built this dashboard to showcase my ability to combine player development insights, data storytelling, and baseball analytics. This project reflects my commitment to developing the skills front offices value—blending **analytical thinking**, **baseball intelligence**, and **human development**.

The goal of this dashboard is to:
- Demonstrate player development trends
- Communicate advanced baseball metrics visually
- Scale easily for future player comparisons or team-level analysis
